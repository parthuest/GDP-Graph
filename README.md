# GDP-Graph
I am using data provided on the link: http://api.worldbank.org/countries/USA/indicators/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?per_page=5000&format=json  
I am ploting this data using d3.js. 
I have used line chart with dots.
When user hover on dots its color, size gets changed. Also values of X and Y axis gets displyed.
Backend node.js code is in backend folder.
Frontend code is in frontend folder. 

Before starting the project you need to install libraries using "npm install" in frontend and backend.
